# Reasoningâ€‘aboutâ€‘GRNâ€‘Ensemblesâ€‘inâ€‘Kidneyâ€‘Injuryâ€‘andâ€‘Repair

**Characterizing Gene Regulatory Network Ensembles in Kidney Injury and Repair**  
A computational framework using RE:IN to infer and analyze ensembles of Boolean gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNAâ€‘seq data in a mouse model of acute kidney injury.

## Project Motivation & Highlights

This work addresses the challenge that multiple GRNs can explain the same transcriptional data. By leveraging the **Reasoning Engine for Interaction Networks (RE:IN)**, we:

1. Inferred language-level **Abstract Boolean Networks (ABN)** for proximal tubule cell states in ischemiaâ€‘reperfusion injury.  
2. Generated  **ensembles of GRN solutions** consistent with observed expression patterns.  
3. Applied **PCA** to reveal four distinct GRN families.  
4. Identified **key subnetwork structures** differentiating those families.  

The resulting methodology enhances our understanding of GRN heterogeneity during kidney injury and repair
